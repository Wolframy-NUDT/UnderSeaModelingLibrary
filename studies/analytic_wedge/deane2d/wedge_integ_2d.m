% Wave number integration for a specific image source (equation 28) in the
% Deane/Buckingham March 1993 paper. Limits the evaluation to 2-D
% contributions, those in the plane of the source. Simpson's rule is used
% to evaluate the complex contour integral along two paths.
%
%    - The first path varies the theta coordinate (wavenumber D/E)
%      along the real axis from 0 to pi/2.  This represents the
%      oscillitory component of the pressure field.
%
%    - The second path varies the theta coordinate (wavenumber D/E)
%      along the imaginary direction from pi/2 to pi/2 - i Inf.
%      This represents the evanescent (decaying) component of the
%      pressure field.
%
% Loops over targets so that integration can be performed on a
% target-by-target basis.
%
%   pressure = wedge_integ_2d( num_surface, num_bottom, ...
%       wave_number, range, zeta )
%
%   pressure    = matrix of complex pressures (one for each target).
%   num_surface = number of surface bounces for current source
%   num_bottom  = number of bottom bounces for current source
%   wave_number = magnitude of the acoustic wave number (scalar)
%   range       = matrix of target ranges from source
%   zeta        = matrix of target depression/elevation angles relative to source
