    <title>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.
    </p>
    <p>USML depends on the NetCDF package, for access to test data, 
       and the Boost package, for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit test utilities.
       Correctly configuring these packages is the #1 problem reported by USML users.
       Before you attempt to build and test USML, please read this section carefully.</p>

    <h3>Problems with Boost package</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> There is a bug in the Boost uBLAS library that prevents us from overloading
         operator/().  To see the corrected version of this code, please search for the 
         symbol BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_DIVISION_TYPE in the <code>vector_expression.hpp</code> 
         and <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code> files in the <code>usml/config</code> directory.
         In each case, the operator/() should be using the enable_if<> macros just like the operator*() 
         just above it. Those using Boost 1.41.0 and later versions can just replace the original files with the
         ones from the <code>usml/config</code> directory.
    </ul>
    <h3>Problems with NetCDF package</h3>
    <ul>
    	 <li>At this time, USML does not support the use of HDF5 or cURL. So in order to use USML and NetCDF 
	 versions 4.0.1 and higher there are two options that you will need to do in order to run USML.</li>
	 <ul>
	 <li>The first option is to download the source code for netcdf at 
	 <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf"> http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf <a/>
	 and configure the install to disable netcdf-4 and dap.</li>
	 <li>The second option is if you wish to keep these features on for netcdf. In order to get USML 
	 to run properly, you will need to alter the CMakeLists.txt to include HDF5/zLib/cURL packages. 
	 If you need to do this, there is a CMakeLists.txt file in the <code>usml/config</code> directory 
	 that is specifically setup to do this for you. NOTE: you will need to download the HDF5/zLib/cURL 
	 packages from source and compile them appropriately. There is also a README.txt provided in the 
	 <code>usml/config</code> directory that assists with this.</li>
	 </ul>
    <li> Unidata's recent refactoring of the NetCDF library (Summer of 2010) hopelessly broke
         the existing port to Microsoft Visual Studio (see 
         <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#windows_netcdf4_1">
         http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#windows_netcdf4_1</a>).
         Until this is fixed by the open source community, Windows developers are expected 
         to create their own NetCDF libraries from source code.  A copy of the 
         CMake-based build that system that we used for testing is freely available on GitHub at
         <a href="https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake">
	 https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake</a>.</li>
     <li>By default, CMake does not include a module to find NetCDF libraries.  Please copy the 
         <code>FindNetCDF.cmake</code> file from the <code>usml/config</code> directory 
         into CMake's shared modules directory.  For Linux it's the <code>/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules</code> directory.</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Building and Testing USML</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of the example, let's assume that you are installing on a Linux
      system into the <code>"~/Projects/usml"</code> directory. Assuming that this is the current
      directory, and that all of the tarballs are here as well, the Linux commands
      to execute would be:
      <pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.##.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.##.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.##.tar.gz
      </pre>
      where #.## is the version number to be installed.
    </p><p>
      This library is built using the CMake cross-platform, open-source build system.
      Users are strongly encouraged to configure their builds using the cmake-gui
      tool.  CMake makes it much easier to support cross-platform builds, but it
      requires a few more steps than a direct Makefile interface.
      For example, a simple Unix build includes the following steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the cmake-gui tool, set the source directory to the place where you
        installed the USML source code.  As suggested above source code could go in <code>"~/Projects/usml"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binaries directory to
        something like the <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory.  Using a binary
        directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional,
        except for the <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Eclipse_CDT4_Generator">Eclipse CMake generator</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the "Configure" button to process the CMakeList file.
        Select the "Unix Makefile" generator from the pop-up menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change any options that you'd like. Note that the USML_PEDANTIC option
        is only used to search for questionable programming during our development.
        <ul>
        	<li>Note: Boost_FORCE_SHAREDLIB should be used if the Boost static test suite libraries are not installed.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Hit the "Configure" button a second time, even if you have not changed any
        options.  Hit the "Generate" button to create makefiles for your system.
        At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the "make" utility from <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory to compile both
        the usml shared libraries and the usml_test regression tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can optionally use "sudo make install" to install the compiled programs into
        the include, lib, and src directories in /usr/local.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running the "usml_test"  regression test should run without errors if the
        compilation and install were successful.  Prints "*** No errors detected".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Mustafa Abbasi, a PhD Student at the University of Texas, has posted the step-by-step process 
    that he used to compile USML.  He posted this procedure in the form of a video on his blog
    (<a href="http://loudflames.wordpress.com/">http://loudflames.wordpress.com/</a>).
    This may help you, especially if you have having trouble setting up the external 
    dependencies. Note that there is no sound in this video.
