    <title>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.
    </p>
    <p>USML depends on the NetCDF package, for access to test data, 
       and the Boost package, for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit test utilities.
       Correctly configuring these packages is the #1 problem reported by USML users.
       Before you attempt to build and test USML, please read this section carefully.</p>

    <h3>Setting up Boost package</h3>
        USML uses the Boost package for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit 
        test utilities. But, many USML users have experienced problems setting 
        up Boost in their development environment. Here are some hints that may help you: 
    <ul>
    <li> CMake's FindBoost utility seems to have problems finding versions of Boost
         that have been installed in <code>/usr/include</code> and 
         <code>/usr/lib</code> as part of the operating system.  These problems
         seem to go away when Boost is built from source code and installed
         in <code>/usr/local/include</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.</li>
    <li> There is a bug in the Boost uBLAS library that vector and matrix 
         scaling using <code>operator/()</code>.  To see the corrected version of this code, please search for the 
         symbol BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_DIVISION_TYPE in the <code>vector_expression.hpp</code> 
         and <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code> files in the <code>usml/config</code> directory.
         In each case, the operator/() should be using the enable_if<> macros just like the operator*() 
         just above it. Those using Boost 1.41 trhough 1.56 can just replace the original files with the
         ones from the <code>usml/config</code> directory.  Boost 1.57 fixed the problem in 
         <code>vector_expression.hpp</code>, but requires replacing <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code>
         with the file <code>usml/config/matrix_expression_1_57.hpp</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Setting up NetCDF package</h3>
    USML uses Unidata's NetCDF package to access environmental data from
    a variety of public sources such as the <a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/">
    National Oceanographic Data Center</a>.  But, many USML users have experienced
    problems setting up NetCDF in their development environment.  Here are 
    some hints that may help you:
    <ul>
     <li>By default, CMake does not include a module to find NetCDF libraries.  
         Please copy the <code>FindNetCDF.cmake</code> file from the <code>usml/config</code> directory 
         into CMake's shared modules directory.  For Linux share modules 
         are kept in the <code>/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules</code> directory.</li>
    <li> On RedHat 6 and CentOS 6 systems, installing the netcdf-devel
         RPM package using the default YUM server seems to work perfectly.</li>
    <li> On other Linux systems, We've had some trouble setting up the 
         HDF5, zLib, cURL libraries that netCDF depdends on.  Loading theses 
         libraries from <a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4/">
         source code</a> and compiling them on your development platform
         seems to work well.  Note that the <code>./configure</code> option for HDF5 works
         best with the the options <code>--with-zlib=/path/to/zlib --disable-parallel 
         --enable-shared</code>. Because USML does not actually use any NetCDF 4
         features, many users have found it useful to download just NetCDF from 
         <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf">source code</a>
         and configuring the build process to disable netcdf-4 and dap.
    <li> On Windows, we've had significant 
         <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#windows_netcdf4_1">
         problems using NetCDF in Microsoft Visual Studio</a>.  A copy of the 
         CMake-based build that system that we used for testing is freely available on GitHub at
         <a href="https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake">
	 https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake</a>.</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Building and Testing USML</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of the example, let's assume that you are installing on a Linux
      system into the <code>"~/Projects/usml"</code> directory. Assuming that this is the current
      directory, and that all of the tarballs are here as well, the Linux commands
      to execute would be:
      <pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.#.#.tar.gz
      </pre>
      where #.#.# is the version number to be installed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note that the USML build process absolutely requires the top level
        directory to be named <code>usml</code>!</b>
	<p>
      For installation from a GitHub zip file, after extraction the topmost directory will need to be
	  changed from <code>"UnderSeaModelingLibrary-branchname"</code> to <code>"usml" </code> for 
	  the CMake build system to function properly.  Also, if cloning the respository from GitHub ensure 
	  the clone takes place from a toplevel directory named <code>"usml"</code>.   The CMake build 
	  system and many of the include references expect the topmost directory  to be <code>"usml"</code>.
    </p>
	<p>
      This library is built using the CMake cross-platform, open-source build system.
      Users are strongly encouraged to configure their builds using the cmake-gui
      tool.  CMake makes it much easier to support cross-platform builds, but it
      requires a few more steps than a direct Makefile interface.
      For example, a simple Unix build includes the following steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the <code>cmake-gui</code> tool (example below), set the source directory to the place where you
        installed the USML source code.  As suggested above source code could go in <code>"~/Projects/usml"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binaries directory to
        something like the <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory.  Using a binary
        directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional,
        except for the <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Eclipse_CDT4_Generator">Eclipse CMake generator</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the "Configure" button to process the CMakeList file.
        Select the "Unix Makefile" generator from the pop-up menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change options to match your development requirements.  The default options
        should be correct for most installations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hit the "Configure" button a second time, even if you have not changed any
        options.  Hit the "Generate" button to create makefiles for your system.
        At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the "make" utility from <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory to compile both
        the usml shared libraries and the usml_test regression tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can optionally use "sudo make install" to install the compiled programs into
        the include, lib, and src directories in /usr/local.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running the "usml_test"  regression test should run without errors if the
        compilation and install were successful.  Prints "*** No errors detected".
      </li>
    </ul>

    that he used to compile USML.  He posted this procedure in the form of a video on his blog

    This may help you, especially if you have having trouble setting up the external
